# Sound Files

This directory contains the sound effects used in the game. You need to add the following sound files:

1. `unscrew.mp3` - A soft "pop" sound when a screw is unscrewed
2. `match.mp3` - A satisfying "click" sound when a screw is matched to a holder
3. `level-complete.mp3` - A celebratory sound when completing a level

The sound files should be:
- Short (1-2 seconds)
- In MP3 format
- Low volume (will be adjusted in-game)
- Clear and distinct

You can find free sound effects from websites like:
- freesound.org
- soundbible.com
- opengameart.org

Make sure to use sounds that are free for commercial use or have appropriate licenses.
